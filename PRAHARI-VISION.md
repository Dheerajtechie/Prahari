# PRAHARI — Founder Vision & Strategy

*Think like the world's best founder. Execute like a genius. This is the playbook.*

---

## The One-Liner

**Prahari is the accountability layer for India: citizens report corruption and civic failure in 60 seconds; AI verifies, blockchain locks it, and the system forces government response—or we auto-file RTI. Doing good pays in real rewards.**

If they can’t say it back in one breath, we haven’t nailed it yet.

---

## Why This Will Win

### 1. **Asymmetric upside**
- **Citizens:** One tap → report → potential reward. Risk is low; upside (cashback, certificates, recognition) is tangible.
- **Government:** Ignoring a report has a *cost* (RTI, media, vigilance). Fixing it has a *benefit* (SLA met, credit). We shift the incentive.
- **Prahari:** We don’t fight the state; we make *inaction* more expensive than *action*.

### 2. **Why now**
- **RTI + digital India:** Legal tools exist; citizens don’t know how to use them. We productize them.
- **AI:** Credibility scoring and triage at scale are finally cheap. One report = one AI call.
- **Trust deficit:** People already believe “nothing happens.” We give them proof that *something* happens (resolved count, ₹ recovered, live feed).
- **Rewards economy:** UPI, vouchers, and govt certificates make “doing good pays” believable.

### 3. **The wedge**
- Start with **one city, one category** (e.g. Bengaluru + potholes/civic infra). Own resolution rate and narrative there.
- “In Bengaluru, 78% of Prahari reports get fixed in 21 days.” That’s the headline. Then expand category and geography.

## Moats (What Competitors Can’t Copy Overnight)

| Moat | What we build | Why it sticks |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Data** | Every report: location, category, department, outcome, time-to-resolution | Becomes the only real-time civic truth set. Govt and media pay for it. |
| **Trust** | Blockchain hash + RTI auto-file + whistleblower mode | “They can’t delete it” is a feature. Legal and reputational lock-in. |
| **Network** | Leaderboard, city stats, live feed, “43 Lac guardians” | Social proof and FOMO. More reporters → more resolution → more reporters. |
| **Rewards supply chain** | UPI, metro, bus, vouchers, IT rebate, national award | Partnerships take time. Catalogue + fulfilment = defensible. |
| **Narrative** | “Every report is a revolution” / “Doing good pays” | Brand is category. First to own “citizen accountability” in India wins the word. |

## Go-to-Market (No Fluff)

### Phase 1 — Proof (Months 1–3)
- **Goal:** One city, 1,000+ reports, 50%+ resolution on one category.
- **Tactics:** Partner with one municipal body or MLA office; they get a dashboard, we get SLA and proof. Run campus/colony drives: “Report one issue, get ₹10 UPI.” Track resolution, not just reports.
- **Metric that matters:** *Resolution rate*, not report count.

### Phase 2 — Replication (Months 4–6)
- **Goal:** 3 cities, 3 categories, 10,000+ active reporters.
- **Tactics:** Media: “₹X Cr recovered / Y% resolved in Z city.” Government: sell “Civic Intelligence Dashboard” to second and third city. CSR: one brand sponsors one city’s reward pool.
- **Metric that matters:** *Revenue per government/CSR partner* and *cost per resolved report*.

### Phase 3 — Scale (Months 7–12)
- **Goal:** 15+ cities, 1M+ reports, sustainable unit economics.
- **Tactics:** Premium (journalists, NGOs, lawyers). Data products (urban planners, research). National awards with PMO/MoHUA. Recovery-linked rewards ( % of corruption recovered).
- **Metric that matters:** *NRR from govt/enterprise*, *LTV of a top reporter*.

## Metrics the Best Founder Would Watch

| Metric | Target (Year 1) | Why |
|--------|------------------|-----|
| **Resolution rate** | >65% (within SLA) | Product is “things get fixed.” Below 50% = broken promise. |
| **Reports per active user** | >2.5 | One report = trial; repeat = habit. |
| **Cost per resolution** | <₹200 | Rewards + ops. Must stay below value created. |
| **Govt/CSR revenue** | ₹50L+ ARR | Proves B2G/B2B; reduces dependency on ads. |
| **Trust score (NPS of reporters)** | >50 | “Would you tell a friend?” If no, growth stalls. |

---

## Risks & How We Neutralize Them

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Govt blocks or ignores** | RTI is law. We’re the channel. Media and vigilance get the data. Make ignoring *visible*. |
| **Fake reports** | AI credibility score; penalize repeat fakers; whistleblower mode for real tipsters. |
| **Reward fraud** | Ledger in DB; partner payouts only after verification; cap redemptions per user. |
| **“Another app that does nothing”** | Don’t claim everything. Claim one city, one category, one number: “78% resolved.” |
| **Burn rate before revenue** | Phase 1 on free tiers (Supabase, Railway, Netlify). First revenue = govt dashboard or CSR, not ads. |

## Narrative (Use This Everywhere)

- **Internal:** “We’re not anti-government. We’re pro-accountability. We make inaction expensive and action visible.”
- **Citizens:** “Report in 60 seconds. AI verifies. Govt gets a deadline. You earn rewards. If they ignore, we file RTI. Your report can’t be erased.”
- **Government:** “Real-time civic intelligence. Fewer complaints to your office. Proof of action. One dashboard.”
- **Investors:** “The accountability layer for India. Citizen-generated, AI-verified, blockchain-anchored, reward-driven. Wedge: resolution rate in one city, then replicate.”

## One-Pager (Copy-Paste for Pitches)

**Prahari** is India’s citizen accountability platform. Users report corruption, encroachment, pollution, and civic issues in under 60 seconds. AI verifies each report and assigns it to the responsible department with a legal SLA. Reports are hashed on blockchain and can’t be altered; if the department doesn’t act, Prahari auto-files an RTI. Citizens earn points and redeem real rewards (UPI, metro, bus pass, govt certificates). We’re live in [X] cities with [Y]% resolution rate. Revenue: government dashboards, CSR reward pools, and Prahari Premium for journalists/NGOs. We’re not building a complaint app—we’re building the infrastructure that makes *not* fixing things more expensive than fixing them.

---

## The Genius Move (What Would Change the Game)

**One number that the whole country knows:**  
*“Prahari resolution rate in [City]: 78%. If your city is below 50%, demand better.”*

That number becomes the standard. Cities compete on it. Media quotes it. That’s when Prahari becomes the *definition* of civic accountability in India.
